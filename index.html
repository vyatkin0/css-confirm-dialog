        <p>I had once a mind to have gone to <span class="highlighted"> the Brazils</span> and have settled
            myself there, for I was, as it were, naturalised to the place; but
            I had some little scruple in my mind about religion, which
            insensibly drew me back.

        <p>Having thus settled my affairs, sold my cargo, and turned all my
            effects into good bills of exchange, my next difficulty was which
            way to go to England: I had been accustomed enough to the sea, and
            yet I had a strange aversion to go to England by the sea at that
            time, and yet I could give no reason for it, yet the difficulty
            increased upon me so much, that though I had once shipped my
            baggage in order to go, yet I altered my mind, and that not once
            but two or three times.</p>
